Hi! I am a PHD studuent in Jinan university. My research interest includes structural health monitoring, inverse problem, vehicle-bridge interaction, moving load identification, structural damage detection and road roughness. I was advised by [Prof. Yu](https://lxxy.jnu.edu.cn/2021/0713/c3706a637375/page.htm) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University.
My published articles are as follows:
1. [B.H.Xu and L.Yu, A novel regularized adaptive matching pursuit from moving force identification using multiple criteriaandpriorknowledge[J]. International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, 23(10) (2023) 2350117.](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219455423501171)
2. [B. H. Xu, Y. H. Chen and L. Yu. Identification of Moving Vehicle Loads Using Instantaneous Vision-Based Vehicle Spatiotemporal Information and Improved Time Domain Method[J]. International Journal of Structural Stability and Dynamics, 2023: 2450163.](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219455424501633)
