Hi! I am a PhD student at Jinan University. My research focus is on numerical methods for inverse problems about moving load identification and structural damage detection. I was advised by [Prof. Yu](https://lxxy.jnu.edu.cn/2021/0713/c3706a637375/page.htm) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

You can contact with me here: [Email](mailto:xbohos@163.com)

Research interests
======
Structural health monitoring, inverse problems, vehicle-bridge interaction, moving load identification, structural damage detection, and road roughness.
