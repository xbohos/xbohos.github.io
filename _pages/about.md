Hi! I am a PhD student at Jinan University. My research focus is on numerical methods for inverse problems about moving load identification and structural damage detection. I am advised by [Prof. Yu](https://lxxy.jnu.edu.cn/2021/0713/c3706a637375/page.htm) from Hong Kong Polytechnic University. 

On this website, I present some of my research and write about topics that I found interesting, mostly related to reproductions of articles and notes on mechanics. 

You can contact with me here: [Email](mailto:xbohos@163.com)
